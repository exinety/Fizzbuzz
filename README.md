My take on this interview test with Lua

Look inside of the Fizzbuzz.lua and hopefully understand my type of working ethic :)

I first bodge things together, and once it works I try to clear up the code and make it easier to read.
Sometimes I add comments while I am working, but mostly I add them once the code is easy to read and wont change much anymore
